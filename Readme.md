# Excel Chaos to Clean Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates how unstructured and messy Excel reports commonly found in operational environments can be transformed into clean, analysis-ready datasets.

The focus of this project is not on Excel formulas, but on data engineering thinking: identifying structure, normalizing data, and preparing it for downstream analysis.

## Common Problems Found in Raw Excel Reports
- Merged cells
- Multi-level headers
- Inconsistent column structures
- Manual data entry errors
- Multiple reporting periods in a single sheet

---

## Approach
1. Identify actual data vs metadata
2. Normalize the data into a single, tabular structure
3. Standardize column names and data types
4. Validate data consistency
5. Prepare dataset for analysis or pipeline integration
